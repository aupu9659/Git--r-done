This commit is a very barebones and ugly landing page for Lazicard. It contains 2 things, an HTML file and a CSS file (under stylesheets). I included some basic information on both of these things in case you're new to web development. 

HTML Files:
-- These are used to display content on a website.
-- Ultimately, a web browser will render what is contained in these files.

CSS Files (stylesheets):
-- These are used to control the way content looks on a website.
-- Things like color, font-size, centering, etc. are all handled within stylesheets.
