Description:

LaziCard is an auto-generated birthday card delivery service which interfaces with the user through a website. This website allows the user to create a username and password so they can access the website at any time. Within their account they will have an address book that can store names, addresses, and birthdates of as many people as desired. Each entry in their address book provides the option to begin/end an annual birthday card delivery service either by email or by a physical card. Unlike other birthday delivery services, our company lets the user set information only once, and ensure a birthday card is sent on time, every year, without any further involvement from the user. At any point, the user can begin or cancel the birthday card delivery service for specific people within their address book.

LaziCard supplies all necessary software to store information and send email birthday cards. For our physical birthday card service Lazicard produces the birthday card, creates the mailing label, and sends these pieces to a manufacturing center where they are assembled and sent off. For this project and class we are focusing on the software. Our team members act as the manufacturing center, when producing the physical birthday cards.

LaziCard recognizes that life changes quickly. This is why our company provides an email reminder one week before sending any and all birthday cards to ensure the user still still wants a birthday card delivered to the contact who's birthday is approaching. Most importantly, LaziCard recognizes that life moves faster than most of us can keep up. We have made it our personal responsibility to ensure that remembering to send birthday cards is one less thing you have to do.

Vision Statement: To prevent birthdays from ever being overlooked.
Motivation:

Everyone likes getting a birthday card. While it’s not a high-value gift, it shows that someone was thinking about you and cares. With that in mind, forgetting someone’s birthday is always a bad feeling. It’s not that you don’t care about that person, but with so much going on in your everyday life, the thought of sending a card, online or physically, doesn’t always happen. LaziCard aims to help.

Risks:

Our company poses the risk that someone may try to store many different email addresses and use our annual email sending service to spam users with birthday cards. While this may not be the worse type of spam, to receive a random birthday card, we are aware that there should be a limit on how many birthday cards can be sent on a particular day to see that our service is not abused. In addition, to add a new contact the user will have to individually enter the information. There is no way to add emails and birthdates in a 'copy-paste' manner, as a scammer would need to do. The scammer would have to manually enter every address.

Risk Mitigation:

We plan to counteract the possible abuse of our website by limiting that at most 5 birthday cards be sent per day. It is very unlikely that an individual has 5 people in their address book that all have birthdays on the same day. In addition, our cards are auto-generated, so there would be no benefit for a scammer to use our service to send emails to other people because the only email that can be sent will be a birthday card. There can be no embedded advertisements. If the scammer tries to advertise by sending a birthday card and signing their name as their company this can not be stopped, but this can be limited by the 5 card maximum birthday card per day rule. But again, getting a birthday card from a random company on a day that is not your birthday won't send a message to use their business, so it is unlikely that scammers will try to use our website.
